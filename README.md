# assisted_installer_agent
## Contents
This projects generates couple of products.  Each one packed in a docker image:
* **agent** - Agent to bm-inventory
* **inventory** - A container image that provides inventory information
* **connectivity_check** - A container image for running connectivity_check
* **free_addresses** - A container image for running nmap to detect free addresses
## agent
The agent communicates with bm-inventory.  It uses the **ghw** library to generate unique uuid identifying the host 
that the agent is running on.
Currently, the functionality of **connectivity_check** is also bundled in the agent itself, besides its dedicated container images.

### Flags

* *--host*:  **Deprecated, use *--url* instead.** The inventory host as dns name or ip address. Default is "api.openshift.com".
* *--port*: **Deprecated, use *--url* instead.** The inventory port number. Default is 80.
* *--url*: The inventory URL, including a schema and optionally a port. Overrides the host and port arguments. If not provided, "http://\<host\>:\<port\>" will be used.
* *--cluster-id*: The cluster id.  Default is "default-cluster".
* *--interval*: Interval in seconds between consecutive times that the agent accesses the inventory.  Default is 60.
* *--inventory-image*: The name of the inventory image.  Default is "quay.io/ocpmetal/inventory:latest"
* *--text*: Dump the inventory as json to the standard output and exit.
* *--connectivity*: Perform connectivity check and dump the results as json to the standard output.  The details of the nodes to check the connectivity with are provided as a parameter having json format.
* *--with-text-logging*: Enable writing the agent logs to /var/log/agent.log. Default is true.
* *--with-journal-logging*: Enable writing logs to systemd journal. Default is true.
* *--insecure*: Skip certificate validation in case of HTTPS transport. Should be used only for testing. Default is false.
* *--cacert*: Path to a custom CA certificate file in PEM format.
* *--help*: Provide help message.

### Packaging
The agent's executable is packaged in a container quay.io/ocpmetal/agent:latest.  The excutable in the container is /usr/bin/agent.

### Running
Since the agent is a statically linked go executable it can be copied and ran outside a container.If running outside a container, 
the agent shoud run as root.  If running in a container, the docker or podman should be invoked with --net=host and --privileged flags.

### Dependecies
* docker

### Building
assisted_installer_agent uses skipper for building and testing.

To build executables run: `skipper make`

To build container images run: `skipper make build-image`

### Testing
Unitests: Run `skipper make unittest`

The subsystem tests uses docker-compose to run the agent and wiremock simulating the inventory.

To perform the subsystem test run: `skipper make subsystem`

To run system tests with regex: `skipper make subsystem FOCUS=register`

### Deployment
To deploy all  container images in the project run `skipper make push`
